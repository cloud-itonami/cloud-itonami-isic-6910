(ns formation.corporate-intel-test
  "Proves the value `formation.corporate-intel` actually adds: an officer
  that is clean on every LOCAL field (no `:sanctions-hit?`, has an id-doc)
  but IS flagged in `cloud-itonami-isic-8291`'s own demo data no longer
  silently clears -- something 6910's local-only checks alone would have
  missed entirely (see `o-4` in `formation.store/demo-data`, shared name
  with 8291's sanctions-flagged demo official).

  Note: `:kyc/screen` NEVER auto-commits at any phase (only
  `:application/intake` does, see `formation.phase`) -- every scenario
  below that reaches `:commit` does so via an explicit approve, same as
  every other `:kyc/screen` test in `governor_contract_test.clj`. Only a
  HARD violation (a local `:sanctions-hit?`, or a stubbed definitive
  corporate-intel `:hit? true`) settles immediately with no interrupt at
  all -- 8291's OWN real hits always escalate for 8291's own human review
  first (no shortcut, no peeking behind its DisclosureGovernor), so the
  end-to-end proof here is 'no longer silently clears', not 'now hard-
  holds' -- see `corporate-intel-catches-the-hit-local-checks-miss` below."
